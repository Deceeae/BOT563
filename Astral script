Strengths: ASTRAL-III is statistically consistent under the multi-species coalescent (MSC) model and significantly improves scalability, 
with a guaranteed polynomial running time of  𝑂 ( 𝐷 ( 𝑛 𝑘 ) 1.726 ) O(D(nk)  1.726  ). It efficiently handles both binary and multifurcating
gene trees, incorporates polytomies, and allows contraction of low-support branches to enhance accuracy.

Weaknesses: The method is sensitive to gene tree estimation errors and does not use branch lengths or nucleotide substitution models. 
Overly aggressive filtering of gene trees can reduce accuracy.

Assumptions: It assumes that discordance among gene trees is primarily due to ILS rather than processes like hybridization or gene duplication.
It also presumes that input trees are unrooted and represent homologous loci

User Choices: Users must decide whether to contract low-support branches (typically below 10% bootstrap is recommended), select which gene trees
to include (e.g., maximum likelihood trees or posterior samples), and optionally tune trimming parameters such as α for heuristic pruning.
